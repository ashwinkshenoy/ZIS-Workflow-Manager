## Core Features:

- Workflow Visualization: Display the workflow as a directed graph, allowing users to visually understand the flow and dependencies, parsing the "StartAt" and "Next" to display the flow.
- Node Configuration Sidebar: Open a sidebar when a node is clicked, displaying the node's properties and allowing users to configure them. Properties extracted by 'type' such as 'ZIS::Flow'.
- Workflow Import: Enable users to import existing workflow definitions in JSON format from URL, and use this as a tool
- Workflow Export: Enable users to export the current workflow definition as a JSON file.
- AI-Powered Suggestions: Provide intelligent suggestions for the workflow, like which existing workflows the user is trying to emulate.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E4057) for a professional and reliable feel, evoking a sense of structure.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean, unobtrusive background that emphasizes the workflow elements.
- Accent color: Teal (#33A3A3) to highlight interactive elements and important actions within the editor.
- Font: 'Inter' for a clean and readable sans-serif font suitable for both the UI and workflow display. (sans-serif)
- Use a clear, structured layout with the workflow canvas taking up the majority of the screen and the configuration sidebar on the right.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for different workflow node types to improve visual clarity.
- Use subtle transitions when opening the configuration sidebar and updating the workflow canvas for a smooth user experience.
